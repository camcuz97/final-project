    <h3>Cameron Cuzmanko</h3>
      <p id="cameron-info">Hi, my name is Cameron Cuzmanko! Iâ€™m going to be starting school at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in fall 2015, and I will be majoring in Computer Science. I like Computer Science because I love to solve problems, and CS is nothing more than a bunch of puzzles and problems requiring solutions. Other than CS,  I really enjoy following soccer and listening to music. This is my first real web app, so I really hope all of you enjoy it:)

    <h3>Manuel Solorzano</h3>
      <p id="manny-info">Hi, my name is Manuel Solorzano. I graduated from DeVry University Advantage Academy and will be majoring in Interactive & Social Media at DePaul University in the fall. I really enjoy CS for the simple fact that it requires a higher level of brain power and makes me think way outside of the box and I really like that. This is the 2nd web app that I have created, next to my online portfolio. Lax Lounge was super fun to create alongside my fellow co-developers, without them, this web app would not be possible.<br><a href="http://msolorzano7.mydevryportfolio.com"> Check out my personal portfolio</a></p>

      <p id="jackie-info">Hi, I am Jackie LaBelle and I will be attending Colorado State University. I will be majoring in Environmental Engineering. I love to  pole vault and spending time outdoors. I like Computer Science because it is a field that is constantly growing and there is always room for development and innovation. This was my first web app and I am really proud of what I have learned and what our group has accomplished in one week.
